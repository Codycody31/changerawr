- [ ] custom fields
- [x] tags can have a color assigned to them (requires updating the SDKs) - partially done DB side, UI implementation must be done.
    - update tag UI to allow for assigning colors
    - update PHP & React SDK to return this value
    - update changelog entries display, changelog tag picker, changelog API to return tag color

- [x] pwnedpasswords password check
- [x] custom domains (what a headache to implement!)
- [x] scheduled publishing
- [x] full-text search
- [ ] version range comparison (catch-up) thinking a digest of what's been done from here-to-there, could be fun!
- [ ] more changelog customization
  - set SEO for public changelog
  - custom scripting for public changelog ( custom js, CSS makes no sense due to changerawr being a CMS)
  - set a logo for your changelog
    - requirements:
    - media manager
    - storage providers (s3, local, maybe google drive not sure)
    - enables for reusable media that can be uploaded to the content editor.

- [ ] ability to specify a custom logo for an SSO provider (will be added when I get around to media storage!)
- [ ] update the MCP server so it can use scheduled publishing
- [ ] collaboration
- [ ] allow for inviting other staff members to work on the same changelog entry
- [x] CLI for Changerawr
- [ ] do stuff with the syncCommit and syncCommitMetadata (no ideas what I could do as of writing)
- [x] extend markdown with custom elements (perhaps, can call it Changerawr Universal Markdown engine) - CUM
- [x] allow for importing a full changelog.md into changerawr to jump-start a project from existing data. look into canny importing as well.
